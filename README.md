# gfw-proxy

## Introduction:

gfw-proxy is a open source software licensed under [GPL-3.0 license](LICENSE.txt) which aims to provide a secure and lightweight method that helps you get rid of the [Great Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall).

## Inspirations:

We've long firmly held the belief that everyone in the world should have the same equality in accessing human knowledge, as well as the ability to enjoy the [Right to Internet access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Internet_access)(or see below). But very unfortunately, if you live in a country where heavy censorship and control are applied everywhere in the internet, you might fail to enjoy your proper rights. Hopefully, we create this software trying our best to give them back to you.

> Right to Internet Access:
> 
> ... all people must be able to access the Internet in order to exercise and enjoy their rights to freedom of expression and opinion and other fundamental human rights, that states have a responsibility to ensure that Internet access is broadly available, and that states may not unreasonably restrict an individual's access to the Internet. 

## How this software work?

You (client) <---(the gfw)---> Proxy Server <-----> Internet

------->---------(can't directly access)-------->--------

All data transferring between you and your proxy server are encrypted (with modern tls1.3 protocol) and look similar to very normal https (http + tls) traffic as long as you send them to port 443 on proxy server.

To receive service from your proxy server, you need to provide a password to help the server identify you from other normal https traffic. If the authorization process fails, you'll be redirect to another real http server and the proxy server acts like a real https server (thus the firewall will be unlikely to block your server just because it looks like a normal https server providing usual services (it doesn't know your password), in another word, you game it!)

## Installation

To get the software working, you need to set up on **both** server side and client side, if didn't yet have any experience in configuring an application, don't worry, the rest of the passage will show you how to do so step by step.

### Server Side Configurations

Introductions:

To get the server working, you'll need...

- a host (server) running linux (I suggest debian for its great stability, but anything else is ok) located somewhere not affected by the firewall (has full internet access), you can buy one from any virtual private server (VPS) provider

- working local http server

- [optional] a domain name (this is not necessary, if you don't have one, don't worry)

- proper x509 certificate used to encrypt and verify data (also no need to worry if you haven't heard about it)

- your great patience and sufficient time (the **most important**)

#### Step 1: get a working http server.

Â This is quit easy to do. All you have to do is to install one. For me, I prefer nginx, so I'll show you how to install it here.

Now I suppose you've successfully logged into your vps (via ssh, for example).

1. You need to install nginx using the following command:

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y nginx 
```

if it says something like `apt command not found`, you're probably using centOS/fodera or some other distros using `dnf` as its package manager, in this case, try

```
sudo dnf install nginx
```

if this doesn't work either, you'd better use your search engine to figure out how to install nginx in your linux distribution.

2. start your nginx by issuing

```
sudo systemctl enable --now nginx
```

3. check if your http server is working by

```
sudo lsof -i:80
```

if you get an error message like `lsof command not found`, install it by replace 'nginx' in step 1 with 'lsof', use search engine if you need help.

if everything works well, you'll get some output says nginx is listening on port 80. But if you got nothing, your http server is not running, go back and check what's wrong.

#### Step 2: get a working certificate

Instead of teaching how to get a certificate from a public ca (certificate authority), I'll show you how to create your own one and trusted by yourself.

1. get a place to store the certificates
   
   ```
   mkdir ~/certs && cd ~/certs
   ```

2. create ca private key
   
   ``` 
   openssl genrsa -out rootCA.key 4096
   ```

3. create root ca certificate
   
   ```
   openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key rootCA.key -sha256 -days 3650 -out rootCA.crt
   ```
   
   you need to answer some questions, if you don't what to fill with, a `.` helps.

4. create your certificate
   
   1. get a place to store your certificates and private key
      
      ```
      mkdir ~/certs/my_certs && cd ~/certs/my_certs
      ```
   
   2. create your certificate key
      
      ```
      openssl genrsa -out my_domain.key 4096
      ```
   
   3. create your csr (certificate signing request) file
      
      - if you have a subdomain name associate with your vps, use this way (replace <FILL_ME_WITH_YOUR_DNS_NAME> with your real domain name (there're 2 places))
        
        ```
        openssl req -new -sha256 \
            -key my_domain.key \
            -subj "/O=My org/CN=<FILL_ME_WITH_YOUR_DNS_NAME>" \
            -reqexts v3_req \
            -config <(cat /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf <(printf "\n[v3_req]\nextendedKeyUsage=serverAuth, clientAuth\nsubjectAltName=DNS:<FILL_ME_WITH_YOUR_DNS_NAME>")) \
            -out my_domain.csr
        ```
      
      - if you do **NOT** have a domain name, it's possible to create your certificate directly with the public IP address (replace <FILL_ME_WITH_YOUR_IP_ADDRESS> with your real IP address)
